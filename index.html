    <p>The Ferrari F12berlinetta[3] (Type F152) is a front mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive grand tourer produced by Italian
      automobile manufacturer Ferrari. The F12berlinetta debuted at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show, and replaced the 599
      grand tourer.[7] The naturally aspirated 6.3 litre Ferrari V12 engine used in the F12berlinetta has won the 2013
      International Engine of the Year Award in the Best Performance category and Best Engine above 4.0 litres. The
      F12berlinetta was named "The Supercar of the Year 2012" by car magazine Top Gear. The F12berlinetta was replaced
      by the 812 Superfast in early 2017.</p>
    <p>The F12berlinetta uses a 6,262 cc (6.3 L; 382.1 cu in), naturally aspirated 65° V12 engine of the Ferrari F140
      engine family. Displacement is shared with the FF, but the F140 FC version installed on the F12 generates a power
      output of 740 PS (544 kW; 730 hp) at 8,250 rpm[2] and 690 N⋅m (509 lb⋅ft) of torque at 6,000 rpm, making it the
      fourth most powerful Ferrari road car produced to date, only surpassed by the LaFerrari, F12tdf and its successor,
      the 812 Superfast.[1][2][9][10]</p>
